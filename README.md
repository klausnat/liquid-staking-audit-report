### Thought process and approach to problem solving

####  1. installed foundry kup and kontrol, created draft for audit-like report:
https://github.com/klausnat/liquid-staking-audit-report/blob/main/LiquidStaking_Audit_Report.md

####  2. went through tutorial (https://docs.runtimeverification.com/kontrol/guides/kontrol-example/k-control-flow-graph-kcfg)

   I noticed one little issue in tutorial, please check file 
   https://github.com/klausnat/liquid-staking-audit-report/blob/main/screenshots/test_title.jpg
   
   the same test has different names in text (I got an error when tried to copy-paste command from tutorial)
   
   In the suggested initial code, test title  differs from test title in suggested command in K Control Flow Graph (KCFG) tab.
   Later though, in `Proof Management` tab, this test was renamed (in Counter.t.sol code)
   
####  3. created tests to check LiquidStaking contract. 

https://github.com/klausnat/liquid-staking-audit-report/blob/main/test/LiquidStakingInitialFailingTests.t.sol

Initially just regular Foundry tests (@TODO add fuzzing tests). Found issues, check screenshot:
https://github.com/klausnat/liquid-staking-audit-report/blob/main/screenshots/foundry_tests_failed.png

Used AI to help me to write tests (included fuzzing tests).

received panic in tests with arithmetic underflow or overflow, and in general, in contract next issues were detected using Foundry

- the contract mixes sETH balances with ETH withdrawals
- balance checks should be added: verification that users have enough sETH for withdrawals
- need to fix exit fee calculation: exit fees are calculated on sETH but subtracted from ETH
- heap removal logic: increment issues in the removeExpired function

(suggested by AI)
Example: in function requestWithdraw we could add:

```solidity
function requestWithdraw(uint256 amountETH, uint256 deadline) external {
        require(amountETH > 0, "Amount to be withdrawn should be positive");
        
        // Convert ETH amount to sETH and check balance
        uint256 sETHAmount = (amountETH * exchangeRate) / 1e18;
        require(sETHBalance[msg.sender] >= sETHAmount, "Insufficient sETH balance");
        
        // Deduct sETH balance immediately
        sETHBalance[msg.sender] -= sETHAmount;
        
        minHeap.push(Withdrawal(msg.sender, amountETH, deadline));
        _heapifyUp(minHeap.length - 1);
        emit WithdrawRequested(msg.sender, amountETH, deadline);
    }
```

 ####  4. Plan for further work and @TODOes

   4.1. **for successfull tests:** each successfull test should be also checked with fuzzing tests (if possible) and kontrol (we know that symbolic executin covers more cases, so formal verification required on top of successful foundry tests)
   
   4.2. **work with failed tests:** suggest changes in source code, list problems for each failing function, implement changes and test with kontrol - do formal verification.
   
   4.3. Write report (https://github.com/klausnat/liquid-staking-audit-report/blob/main/LiquidStaking_Audit_Report.md) 
        with a table of contents and a list of all tests performed, errors found, and suggestions... with appendix.

   4.5. Linting notes from Foundry (include in report)
  https://github.com/klausnat/liquid-staking-audit-report/blob/main/screenshots/linting_notes_foundry.png

 Recommend in report to change code according to these lints, to follow Solidity best practices.
   
####  5. Formal verification with Kontrol    

   5.1. I left only 5 tests,  successfully passed in foundry (need to check them with Kontrol):
   https://github.com/klausnat/liquid-staking-audit-report/blob/main/test/LiquidStaking.t.sol
   
   5.2. installed cheatcodes, added ast = true to my foundry.toml, then did `kontrol build` => âœ… Success! Kontrol project built ðŸ’ª

   Kontrol found bug while with Foundry this test passed successfully

   ![kountrol found security vulnerability](https://github.com/klausnat/liquid-staking-audit-report/blob/main/screenshots/Revert_if_not_owner_Proof_failed.png)

   5.3. I analyzed the bug kontrol found: it is a security vulnerability in the smart contract

   Test passes in Foundry because under normal conditions, it reverts with "Not the contract owner"

   But Kontrol proved there are other execution paths where the call could revert for different reasons (or no reason)

** kontrol output **

    - EVMC_REVERT: The transaction reverted

    - No revert reason: The revert happened without your expected error message

    - Path condition: #Top means this can happen in the default execution path

    - Model: Shows the symbolic values that triggered the bug

        block.timestamp = 1073741825

        block.number = 16777217


   This reveals a real bug: Missing validation in constructor

   My test was incomplete because it didn't account for all the ways the contract state could be initialized incorrectly.

 ** Solution 1: Add Validation to Constructor **
```solidity

constructor(uint256 initialExchangeRate, bool initialExitFeeEnabled) {
    require(initialExchangeRate > 0, "Exchange rate must be greater than zero"); // âœ… Add validation
    exchangeRate = initialExchangeRate;
    exitFeeEnabled = initialExitFeeEnabled;
    owner = msg.sender;
}
```

** Solution 2: Use Initializer Pattern ** 
```solidity

constructor() {
    owner = msg.sender;
    // Don't initialize sensitive parameters in constructor
}

function initialize(uint256 initialExchangeRate, bool initialExitFeeEnabled) external onlyOwner {
    require(initialExchangeRate > 0, "Exchange rate must be greater than zero");
    require(exchangeRate == 0, "Already initialized"); // Prevent re-initialization
    exchangeRate = initialExchangeRate;
    exitFeeEnabled = initialExitFeeEnabled;
}
```
